TO-DO
* It is nice to see how many trials significantly 
correlate with a noise signal or all noise signals
in general and then be able to remove it. So (1) add
the option to correct or not (by trial), then get
a summary of what correlates and to what extent,
across nosie signals (as presently implemented in 
summary.icac) but also add by noise signal (as an
trigger in summary.icac; exactly the same, but per
noise signal), (2) in vis.ic, add option to see a
subset of ICs (the rows of the plot) for each trial
(the pages), with or without a specific noise signal
overlaid (with color coding for sig or non-sig),
(3) based on this, update the icac object.

--------------------
version 2.3.4.4
-----
* VIGNETTE WILL NEED TO BE UPDATED!
* Added functionality to function ``update.icac''.
It can now sero-out or add back in whole ICs.
* Added functions ``summary.icac'', ``topo.ic'', and
``vis.ic''.
* Renamed function ``plotSummary'' --> ``vis.smry''.
* Tweaked all the plotting functions. Among other things, 
k is always set to 5 and gamma is always set to 0.
--------------------
version 2.3.4.3
-----
* Revised the example in ``icaOcularCorrection''.
--------------------
version 2.3.4
-----
* Added function ``plotSummary''.
--------------------
version 2.3.2
-----
* Added package vignette in PDF, R, and Rnw formats.
* Arbitrarily added ``set.seed(0)'' to function ``icac'' 
to ensure reproducibility between runs. 
* Revised function ``update.icac'' to accept ``method = zero-out''.
* Set the default of argument ``method'' in function ``icac''
to ``zero-out'', which is much faster than ``subtract'' and 
appears to give the same results (although more testing is
necessary to ascertain this 100%).
* Revised the example in ``icaOcularCorrection''.
--------------------
version 2.3.1
-----
* Modified the example in ?icaOcularCorrection.
--------------------
version 2.3
-----
* Tweaked all the functions (except mwd.thrsh). There
was a major tweak to function ``plot.icac''.
* Change the name of function ``revise.icac'' to
``update.icac'' to keep in line with existing functions
with a similar functionality.
--------------------
version 2.2
-----
--------------------
version 2.0
-----
Re-vamped the ICA denoising function and plotting 
function as follows:
* There are now only two funtions with enhanced 
functionality, ``icac'' to correct for artifacts
(ocular or other), and ``plot.icac'' to plot a an
object of class ``icac'' returned by the function
of the same name.
* Function ``defineElectrodeSet'' is now named ``des''
and accepts value ``egi.128'' in addition ot the previous
ones.
* Added function ``snr'' to calculate signal-to-noise
ratios of an ``icac'' object.
--------------------
version 1.3
-----
* Changed default of ``n.comp'' argument in functions
``icaDEN.fnc'' and ``batch.icaDEN.fnc'' from ``NA'' to
16.
* Added function ``mc.batch.icaDEN.fnc''
* Removed plotting arguments from function ``icaDEN.fnc''.
* In functions ``batch.icaDEN.fnc'' and ``mc.batch.icaDEN.fnc''
changed plotting arguments to ``pdf.it'', ``pdf.prefix'', and
``pdf.compress''.
* Added argument ``pdf.compress'' to function ``plotICs.fnc''.
* For next version: 
	-- Add an automatic number of components estimator as in FSL
